# Java Console Projects Collection

Welcome to my collection of Java-based console interaction programs! This repository serves as a central hub for a variety of small to mid-scale projects developed using pure Java and designed to run in a command-line environment.

Each project is housed in its own folder and explores different aspects of Java programming—from basic logic and user input handling to more structured problem-solving patterns. Whether you're learning Java, brushing up on your skills, or just curious about how things work under the hood, you'll likely find something interesting here.

## 🔧 What's Inside

This repository includes programs such as:

- Interactive tools and utilities  
- Simple games and logic puzzles  
- Educational mini-projects  
- Algorithm practice exercises  

Each folder includes a dedicated `README.md` file with instructions, a description, and notes on how the program works.

## 🛠️ How to Run

To run any of the Java console programs:

1. **Navigate to the folder** of the program you want to run.
2. **Compile the Java file** using the `javac` command:
   ```bash
   javac ProgramName.java
3. **Run the compiled program** using the `java` command:
   ```bash
   java ProgramName

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is built for:

- Practicing and improving Java programming skills
- Exploring basic to intermediate concepts through small projects
- Sharing clean and simple code that others can learn from or expand on

It’s especially useful for beginners, students, and self-learners who want to understand Java through hands-on examples that are easy to read and run.
